## Multi-channel analog conversion

The analog voltage converter board consist of 8 channels dividing a 5 V or 10 V analog signal to a 1 V signal. The input voltage can be selected with a jumper. Additionally, another jumper can limit the output current to 1.6V. This board is used in conjunction with a FPGA (Au, Alchitry) in the [MicroFPGA](https://github.com/jdeschamps/MicroFPGA) project.

The project contains the following items:

- [Altium project](Altium_project)
- [Bill of materials](BOM)
- [Gerber files](Gerber)
- [Drill instructions](NC_Drill)

The board was designed, produced and tested by Christian Kieser (Electronic workshop, EMBL).
